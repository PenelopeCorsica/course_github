## Before we start

--

- Have you created your GitHub account?


--
- Are you now a member of the GitHub ClinicalBrainLab organization?

???
everyone signs in, look for clinicalbrainlab gh organization
Checking the list of members would be a good way to see if everyone is there

---
## What is GitHub?

--
- Originally: a system and space of open-source computer code

--

- Now : the largest open-source community extending far beyond programming

## What is (so great about) GitHub? 

--

### Open-access repos
  - Open **collaboration** and transparency
  
  - Great for sharing material, tools, data
  
  - Great for discussing ideas, reporting bugs, making suggestions...

--

### Private repos
  - Great for **version-control** 
  
  - Integration with a lot of tools (Overleaf, OSF, etc.)

## How is it relevant to Psychology researchers?

--
### **As developers**

--

- Share your hardwork with others!

--

- **Tasks**: e.g., [ComplexSpan](https://github.com/neuropsychology/ComplexSpan)

--

- **Useful Tools**: [Email automation](https://github.com/colinquirk/autoemailer), E-prime converters in [Python](https://github.com/tsalo/convert-eprime) and [R](https://github.com/tjmahr/rprime)

--

- **List of resources**: Everything under the sun: [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome), R: [awesomeR](https://github.com/ktaranov/AwesomeR), Python: [awesomePython](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python), Open-source data: JHU COVID-19 data

## How is it relevant to Psychology researchers?

--
### **As Users**

--

- Benefit from the hardwork of others!

--

- **Preprocessing pipelines**: [fmriprep](https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep), [NeuroKit](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit)

--

- **Follow updates of functions** (R, Python): [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse), [easystats](https://github.com/easystats), [spm](https://github.com/spm)

--

- **Raise issues**: https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues

-- 

- **Learn programming**: Contributing to software is the best way of learning a language.

## Exercise 1: Create a repository

- Initialize with `README.md` (this is the core of each repo, and usually contains all useful information about it)

- Make multiple commits

- Show commit history

---
## Exercise 2: Fork repository

- Fork the website repository

- Update profile (step-by-step)

---
## Using GitHub: Summary of Features
