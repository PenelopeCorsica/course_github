## Before we start{.build}

- Have you created your GitHub account?
<!--  everyone signs in, look for clinicalbrainlab gh organization -->
- Are you now a member of the GitHub ClinicalBrainLab organization?
<!-- Checking the list of members would be a good way to see if everyone is there -->

## Outline

- Introduction to GitHub
- Exercise 1: Create a repository
- Exercise 2: Fork a repository 
- Using GitHub henceforward
- Next session?

## What is GitHub?

- Originally a repository of open-source for computer code
